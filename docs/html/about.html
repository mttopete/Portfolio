    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>My name is Mateo Topete, i am 24 years old and have been programming for about 10 years. I got my start using Lua in a mod called ComputerCraft on a modded minecraft server back
        when i was 12-13 years old. I was hooked immediately and spent from then until sophomore year of high school experimenting with the mod and teaching myself what i could
        manage to pick up from online videos. At one point i had signed up for "university" classes on a minecraft server where people would join a teamspeak call and
        teach us about programming concepts in-game while we followed along. <br>
        <br>
        In my second year of high school a teacher took it upon themselves to start a computer science pathway for the high school. I signed up for and took the first class
        ever offered to find that the teacher was almost completely new to programming. Since i had taught myself in the years prior, i was able to work together with her
        to help teach each other and the class the fundamentals. Together we learned from each other, the textbooks, and our own experimentation over the rest of the term. Afterwards
        I continued to come in at lunch and spend time in the classroom helping other students, the teacher, or working on my own small projects. Over the remaining 2 and a half years i
        continued to take each new class as it was offered and spent most of the time in each one pushing myself to the edges of what was being taught with the teacher so that future
        classes could have a better time. Shortly after i graduated, there were enough classes available for our school to offer AP Computer science and CS-based pathways for students.<br>
        <br>
        Most recently, i graduated with a Bachelors in computer science with a focus in Intelligent Systems from the University of California Irvine. Coursework and the rest of college
        filled my time during those years, but after graduating i have returned to learning through personal projects and online resources. Currently i am looking into applications and techniques
        for different areas of Artificial Intelligence and learning to mod Minecraft with a friend in a group project. Most recently i have started to turn to end-to-end projects rather than
        just machine learning in an effort to stand out with experience for job applications. Working with so many new technologies on my own is challenging but rewarding, i'm excited to
        eventually be able to present my work in a usable and professional way rather than just a collection of python scripts that train and validate on data.
    </p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>While searching for a job, i spend a lot of time on projects, following learning resources, and applications. In my free time i like to</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Read</b>- Currently the Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix</li>
        <li><b>Play Games</b>- Valheim, Baldurs Gate 3, Risk of Rain 2, Fire Emblem</li>
        <li><b>Exercise</b>- Swimming, running, weights, bike rides</li>
        <li><b>Build Legos</b>- as soon as i find more places to put them</li>
        <li><b>Learn new skills</b>- trying to learn Guitar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Kura</h2>
    <p>
        Kura is my cat and co-pilot. She has the incredible 6th sense to know when i really need to focus and decide that she would like attention. Her hobbies include:
        sitting on plates that you planned to eat off of, looking at you from a distance but refusing to come closer, rolling on concrete, and of course chewing any plastic
        she can find.
