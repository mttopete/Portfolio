        <h2>Medical Chatbot</h2>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>I started this project to get familiar with the current generative AI trends. I picked this specifically because it was part of an online course that was going over
            implementations and fundamentals of generative AI. It was a fun opportunity to see what goes on behind the scenes with something so widely used as
            generative language models.
        </p>
        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pinecone Vector Database</li>
            <li>Hugging Face API</li>
            <li>LangChain</li>
            <li>Flask</li>
            <li>Meta Llama2 Model</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The project used a variant of the Meta Llama 2 model downloaded from the HuggingFace website. The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine was stored as a collection of vectors
            using the Pinecone Vector Store API. The LangChain API was then used to chain the results from user input, the vector store, and the LLM to generate answers 
            based on the contents of the Encyclopedia. The application was finally deployed using Flask locally.
            <br><br>
            The project was an interesting learning experience both for its introduction to generative AI as well as learning good practices for setting up usable file 
            structures.

        <h2>Multiple Choice Question Generator</h2>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of this project was to gain experience directly interacting with a popular LLM through API calls. The the idea for the project was
            shared by an online learning resource used to help guide my learning in developing applications using popular generative AI models.
            It was also good practice exploring the AWS console and deploying an actual application to AWS beyond the textbook theory reading i did
            for the certification.        
        </p>
        <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenAI</li>
            <li>LangChain</li>
            <li>StreamLit</li>
            <li>AWS</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
            The application used a free API key from openAI for the GPT 3.5-Turbo model. Prompts were fed to the model with the LangChain API.
            The gui was created using StreamLit to simplify having to design one fully from scratch. It takes an input for the number of MCQ's to be
            generated ranging from 3-50, a subject to focus on, a complexity level for the questions, and finally a text or pdf file to read and use as the
            material that the questions should be based off of. The initial generation of questions are passed back to the LLM with a second prompt asking
            it to review the questions to ensure they are appropriately referencing the material and are of the difficulty requested.
            The application as briefly hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, but was taken down to avoid accumulating fees.
            <br><br>
            The biggest takeaway from this project was a new meaning to the job postings i see for "AI Prompt Engineer". Until i experimented with different prompts
            firsthand i didn't know just how much variance there could be in answers depending on how well or poorly the initial prompt was written. I enjoyed being able
            to apply what i learned from the AWS dev-ops certification too rather than having it be all theoretical knowledge for multiple choice questions.

        <h2>Across the Wall - a Minecraft Mod</h2>
        <p>
            The mod is still early in development while my coding partner focuses on college. The repository is still private while we learn the ins and outs of
            java and the tools for modding minecraft from the ground up. It has also been a great learning experience for using github alongside other people rather
            than my usual personal projects which have little need for checking out branches and other features of git i rarely used alone.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by Garth Nix's series <a href = "https://garthnix.com/books/the-old-kingdom/" target="_blank">The Old Kingdom </a> and motivated by the need for a new
            quality magic mod in Minecraft after so many of our childhood mod creators have retired to pursue other jobs, we plan to add the full magic system from the books
            into Minecraft.<br>
            So far we have created and textured the main magical items and ores, added some experimental functionality to them, and created the first of many new Dimensions that
            will be present. Currently the project is on pause until summer break rolls around for California Colleges.

        <h2>Coursera Projects/Exercises</h2>
            <p>
                The code is locked to their subscription service, however it did provide a great guided-learning experience and exposure to technologies
                that would otherwise be difficult to implement as a team of one both in complexity and cost of paying a host like AWS,GCP,or Azure.

        <h2>Misc scripts / Small edits</h2>
        <p>
            Not large enough to be full projects, i create scripts to solve problems on the fly for me and friends,
            as well as dive into existing open-source code to make tweaks for personal use while learning the code as i go.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Auto-dodge script based on pixle color of specific game regions</li>
            <li>Tweaks to the <a href = "https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create" target = "_blank">Create </a>mod for minecraft for a personal server</li>
            <li>Edits to skyrim mods and load orders</li>
            <li>A bot for discord to play music when Google began its war on music bots (stopped working years ago when google won)</li>
            <li>Scripts in Lua for <a href = "https://www.computercraft.info" target="_blank">ComputerCraft</a>, a mod for minecraft where i got my start programming and still do today</li>
