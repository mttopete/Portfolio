        <h2>Across the Wall - a Minecraft Mod</h2>
        <p>
            The mod is still early in development while my coding partner focuses on college. The repository is still private while we learn the ins and outs of
            java and the tools for modding minecraft from the ground up.
            <br><br>
            Inspired by Garth Nix's series <a href = "https://garthnix.com/books/the-old-kingdom/" target="_blank">The Old Kingdom </a> and motivated by the need for a new
            quality magic mod in Minecraft after so many of our childhood mod creators have retired to pursue other jobs, we plan to add the full magic system from the books
            into Minecraft.<br>
            So far we have created and textured the main magical items and ores, added some experimental functionality to them, and created the first of many new Dimensions that
            will be present. Currently the project is on pause until summer break rolls around for California Colleges.

        <h2>Coursera Projects/Exercises</h2>
            <p>
                The code is locked to their subscription service, however it did provide a great guided-learning experience and exposure to technologies
                that would otherwise be difficult to implement as a team of one both in complexity and cost of paying a host like AWS,GCP,or Azure.

        <h2>Misc scripts / Small edits</h2>
        <p>
            Not large enough to be full projects, i create scripts to solve problems on the fly for me and friends,
            as well as dive into existing open-source code to make tweaks for personal use while learning the code as i go.
        </p>

            <li>Auto-dodge script based on pixle color of specific game regions</li>
